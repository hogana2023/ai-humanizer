# AI Humanizer Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for evaluating the effectiveness of our AI humanizer web application. The primary goal is to verify that our humanization algorithms successfully transform AI-generated text to bypass AI detection tools while maintaining readability and coherence.

## Test Cases

### 1. Sample AI-Generated Content
We'll use various types of AI-generated content to test our humanization algorithms:

- **Academic Text**: Formal writing with complex sentence structures
- **Creative Writing**: Narrative text with descriptive language
- **Technical Documentation**: Specialized vocabulary and explanatory content
- **Casual/Conversational**: Informal writing with simpler structures

### 2. AI Detectors to Test Against
We'll evaluate our humanized text against these popular AI detection tools:

1. **GPTZero**: Popular for academic settings, focuses on perplexity and burstiness
2. **Originality.ai**: Commercial tool used by content publishers
3. **Content at Scale**: Provides detailed AI probability scores
4. **ZeroGPT**: Free tool with high accuracy for GPT detection
5. **Copyleaks**: Enterprise-grade AI content detector

### 3. Humanization Settings to Test
We'll test various combinations of settings:

- **Intensity Levels**: Low (0.3), Medium (0.6), High (0.9)
- **Modes**: Standard, Academic, Creative, Casual
- **Advanced Settings**: Various combinations of perplexity, burstiness, vocabulary diversity, and sentence variation

## Testing Methodology

### Step 1: Generate Test Content
- Use the `/api/samples` endpoint to get standardized test content
- Create additional test cases using ChatGPT and other AI tools
- Ensure variety in length, complexity, and subject matter

### Step 2: Baseline Detection Testing
- Run original AI-generated content through each detector
- Record detection scores and confidence levels
- Establish baseline detection rates for each content type

### Step 3: Humanization Processing
- Process each test case through our humanization API
- Use different settings combinations for each test case
- Record processing time and changes made

### Step 4: Post-Humanization Detection Testing
- Run humanized content through the same detectors
- Record new detection scores and confidence levels
- Calculate improvement percentages

### Step 5: Readability and Quality Assessment
- Evaluate humanized text for:
  - Grammatical correctness
  - Semantic coherence
  - Preservation of original meaning
  - Natural flow and readability

## Success Metrics

1. **Primary Metric**: Bypass Rate
   - Percentage of humanized texts that successfully bypass AI detection
   - Target: >80% bypass rate across all detectors

2. **Secondary Metrics**:
   - **Score Improvement**: Average reduction in AI probability scores
   - **Quality Preservation**: Readability and coherence ratings
   - **Processing Efficiency**: Time required to humanize text

## Test Tracking Template

For each test case, we'll record:

```

  - Coherence: [1-5 rating]
  - Meaning Preservation: [1-5 rating]
Notes: [Observations, issues, or insights]
```

## Algorithm Refinement Strategy

Based on test results, we'll refine our algorithms by:

1. Identifying patterns in detection failures
2. Strengthening algorithms for specific content types that show lower bypass rates
3. Adjusting default settings based on most successful configurations
4. Implementing additional humanization techniques if needed
5. Optimizing for both detection avoidance and quality preservation

## Timeline

1. Initial Testing: 1-2 days
2. Algorithm Refinement: 1-2 days
3. Verification Testing: 1 day
